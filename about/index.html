title: About the Authors of this Blog

Hello, my name is Nguyen Quang Phu. <br>
I am currently a student at the Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering, Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT), part of the Vietnam National University. <br>
Originally, I have an interest in the applications of Machine Learning so this has motivated me to study it more deeply. I strive to understand the fundamentals and effectively apply basic Machine Learning models as well as advanced Deep Learning models. <br>
I created this blog to document what I have learned alongside my team. While the blog may contain some mistakes, I welcome any feedback from readers to help improve and refine it.<br>

The content of this website is compiled by three members:
<br>
- Nguyen Quang Phu
<br>
- Nguyen Ngoc Khoi
<br>
- Nguyen Minh Khoi
<br>
We are students of the 22nd cohort majoring in Artificial Intelligence (AI) within the Computer Science program at the Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT).
<br>
This website documents our learning journey for the Program Integration Project course, guided by our advisor, Professor Nguyen An Khuong. For this course, we chose the topic: Detect AI-Generated Text. Under the professor's guidance, we focused on theoretical concepts and understanding the mathematics behind them.
<br>
We are very grateful to him for everything we have learned in this course.
